\subsubsection{Setting}
Exponential growth in computational power and new micro-data allow
the empirical implementation of models where large number of agents (e.g., locations) interact 
with each other in multiple ways (e.g., spatial linkages).

Consider a system of $N$ locations across which there are $H$ types of interactions whose equilibrium 
can be reduced to a set of $N \times H$ equations of the following forms:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:AAL_NH_system}
    x_{ih} = \sum_{j = 1}^N f_{ijh}(x_{j1}, x_{j2}, \cdots, x_{jH})
\end{equation}
where $\{ x_{ih}\} \in \mathbb{R}_{++}^{N \times H}$ reflect the (strictly positive) equilibrium outcome
of each interaction in each locations,
and $f_{ijh}: \mathbb{R}_{++}^{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{++}$ are known functions that govern the interactions across locations.
In other words, $f_{ijh}$ governs the impact of location $j$ on $i$'s $h$ via $H$ linkages.

\subsection{Overview}
This paper provides a new theorem that offers
\begin{enumerate}
    \item an iterative algorithm for calculating an equilibrium and 
    \item sufficient and “globally necessary” conditions under which the equilibrium is unique.
\end{enumerate}
In short, this paper approaches the analysis of $N^2 \times H$ functions $\{ f_{ijh} \}$ in equation~(\ref{eqn:AAL_NH_system})
to a $H \times H$ matrix $(\mathbf{A})_{hh'} \equiv \sup_{ij} \left( \mid \frac{\partial \ln f_{ijh}}{\partial \ln x_{jh'}} \mid \right)$
that characterize the strength of the economic interactions.
